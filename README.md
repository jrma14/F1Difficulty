# F1 Difficulty Calculator (EJS Version)
<!--https://f1-difficulty-calculator.herokuapp.com-->

This application allows a user to input a laptime that they have set in a time trial in the F1 22 Game at a given circuit and it will display and save the ai difficulty associated with that laptime. This is to help users understand what ai difficulty they should be playing at. The average across all circuits is also shown and there is no difference between the map and list page, just preference.

This app uses Express, ejs, Tailwindcss, Daisyui and MongoDB.
